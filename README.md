- 👋 Hi, I’m @legalCriminal (thats a joke i ain't criminal but since my tools should ONLY be used in networks in which you have been given a piece of paper clearly stating you are hired to do ethical hacking on the said network, and not just use this as a skript kiddie on anything i find on shodan, we will call me "LegalCriminal")
- 👀 I’m interested in privacy, for anyone no discrimination, you are a criminal? you need privacy more than anyone!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything, i've started programming when i was 11yo but each year i learned things that bring my understanding to a lower level, so now my goal is understanding what a malicious hacker would try as exploit to bring your privacy down, im here to put it back to an equal level
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on "Pretty fucking Good Privacy" aka PGP but without some of the vulnerabilities 
- 📫 I'm reachable here, find a way to send me a notification with your message and i will not reach out to you if you gave me a way to reply unless it is on this platform
